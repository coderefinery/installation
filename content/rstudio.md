# RStudio

[RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio) is a popular coding environment for R. It is **free and open source** and runs on your desktop and is
available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.  
**If you are an R user and already use RStudio, we recommend to start with this one**.
