# GitHub account

In CodeRefinery workshop, we use the public GitHub service and you need an
account at <https://github.com>. To use GitHub, you will need a [supported web
browser](https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/). Basic GitHub
accounts are free.

If you are concerned about the personal information to reveal to GitHub, for
example how to keep your email address private, please review [these
instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/)
for keeping your email address private provided at GitHub.

We are trying to make it possible to follow this course also with other Git
hosting services but this is work in progress.


## Create a GitHub account

1. Go to <https://github.com>.
2. Click on the "Sign up" at the right-top corner.
3. Enter your username of your choice (if it is already used, you will get some suggestions), email address, and password.
4. Follow further instruction and verify your account.

GitHub may require you to enable multi-factor authentication
(MFA). This is generally a good thing, but may take some time to set
up. Luckily, you probably don't have to do this immediately. If you
are prompted to enable MFA before the end of CodeRefinery, follow
GitHub's instructions since they are usually pretty good.

## If you prefer not using GitHub

If you prefer not to create a GitHub account, you can still follow along with
the lessons.  We highly recommend the GitHub account if you are in a
interactive workshop, because we can't support other platforms and a
few exercises don't work. If you are following CodeRefinery at your
own pace, you will have time to work these out.

GitLab is a good alternative - <https://gitlab.com> or a local
version.

- Anything can be done with other web repositories, but we don't say
  how.  You will need to figure out where to click yourself.
- Most Collaborative Git lesson exercises won't work out of the
  box/will need adapting (but in principle the same idea exists with
  GitLab).
- The continuous integration (CI) lessons such as documentation and
  software testing won't work without adapting. With GitLab you need
  to provide your own [CI runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/),
  which is probably beyond the scope of what you would do just for
  this workshop.
