# GitHub account

In CodeRefinery workshop, we use the public github.com service and you need an
account at github.com. To use github.com, you will need a [supported web
browser](https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/). Basic GitHub
accounts are free.

If you are concerned about the personal information to reveal to GitHub, for
example how to keep your email address private, please review [these
instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/)
for keeping your email address private provided at GitHub.

We are trying to make it possible to follow this course also with other Git
hosting services but this is a process.


## Create a GitHub account

1. Go to <https://github.com>.
2. Click on the "Sign up" at the right-top corner.
3. Enter your username of your choice (if it is already used, you will get some suggestions), email address, and password.
4. Follow further instruction and verify your account.


## Activate 2-factor authentication

1. Sign into GitHub with your newly created account.
2. At the right-top corner, you will find your icon in a circle. Click the down arrow and select "settings".
3. From the menu on the left side, select "Account security".
4. Enable "Two-factor authentication" by a method of your choice.

```{warning}
If you enable 2-factor authentication, you will have to {doc}`set up
SSH keys <ssh>, which we go over on the next page`.  Either way, ssh
keys for connecting to Github will be required for Github after in
August 2021.
```


## Avoiding Github

If you don't make the Github account, you can still follow along with
the lessons.  We highly recommend the Github account if you are in a
interactive workshop, because without it you won't be able to follow
along with some exercises (If you are following CodeRefinery at your
own pace, you will have time to work these out).

- Anything can be done with other web repositories, but we don't say
  how.  You will need to adjust this yourself.
- Most Collaborative Git lesson exercises won't work out of the
  box/will need adapting.
- The continuous integration (CI) lessons such as software testing
  won't work without adapting.
