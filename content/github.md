# GitHub account

In CodeRefinery workshop, we use the public github.com service and you need an
account at github.com. To use github.com, you will need a [supported web
browser](https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/). Basic GitHub
accounts are free.

If you are concerned about the personal information to reveal to GitHub, for
example how to keep your email address private, please review [these
instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/)
for keeping your email address private provided at GitHub.

We are trying to make it possible to follow this course also with other Git
hosting services but this is a process.

2. Click on the "Sign up" at the right-top corner.
3. Enter your username of your choice (if it is already used, you will get some suggestions), email address, and password.
