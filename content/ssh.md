# SSH connection to GitHub

[This CodeRefinery video about ssh keys (7
min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCDg1mtaA5I&list=PLpLblYHCzJACyKCfHnPwRruOxllNoHsEg)
shows how to set up SSH connection to GitHub, so please first watch this.

Using the SSH protocol, you can connect and authenticate to remote servers and
services. With SSH keys, you can connect to GitHub without supplying your
username or password at each visit.

This step was optional in the past but will be necessary because soon it will
not be possible to publish (git push) changes to GitHub with username and
password alone.

For the further guidance, please follow [this
guide](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) to
connect to GitHub with SSH keys.
