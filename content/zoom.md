# Zoom

Zoom is need in online workshops.  You will receive the meeting
link/ID/password if you are registered.


## Installation

We recommend that you install the Zoom client (<https://zoom.us/download>).

You will be encouraged (but not forced) to use a webcam during the
workshop during the breakout sessions.  If you don't want
the physical room you're in to be visible on the webcam, Zoom allows
users to [set up a virtual
background](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/210707503-Virtual-Background)
You might also be asked to share your screen during group exercises or
in interactions with a workshop helper.  Remember to keep private
information away from the screen you share!

You could possibly do this only from a web browser, but for such a
long session, the quality is likely to be higher with the application
installed.  If you use a web browser, we have noticed that Safari and
Firefox don't always work.  Chrome usually does.

**One computer for chat and one for doing the exercises?** You can use
Zoom in a web browser (Chrome) on the exercise computer in order to
share the screen, since screen sharing is *very* important for
productivity.  Have the second one join like normal, with no audio,
same name (you can put "(screen)" at the end to distinguish them, and
if we don't notice ourselves, ask it to be put in the same breakout
room.


## Verify installation

Join one of the pre-workshop installation verification sessions.  If
Zoom works in any other event, it will probably work here, too.


## Zoom signals

We'll go over this in the workshop introduction, but you could get
familiar with the [zoom signals we will
use](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/zoom-mechanics/).
