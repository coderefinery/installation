# Instructions for removing accounts

You may wish to remove the projects and accounts that we have created. Here we
list instructions for how to achieve that:


## [GitHub](https://github.com)

- [Deleting a GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-a-repository/)
- [Deleting a GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-your-user-account/)


## [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org)

- [Deleting a Read the Docs account](https://readthedocs.org/accounts/delete/)

During the workshop we implicitly create a Read the Docs account by signing in using GitHub (or GitLab).
