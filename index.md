# CodeRefinery workshop software installation instructions

This page contains installation instructions for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
Please follow the instructions for your operating system.

Tools we use in a typical CodeRefinery workshop:
- [Bash](/installation/bash/)
- [Terminal editors](/installation/editors/)
- [Git](/installation/git/)
- [Python](/installation/python/)
- [Visual diff tools](/installation/difftools/)
- [Jupyter and JupyterLab](/installation/jupyter/)
- [Snakemake](/installation/snakemake/)
- [Setting up and removing accounts](/installation/accounts/)
- [Troubleshooting](/installation/troubleshooting/)

Tools we use only in specialized workshops:
- [Compilers](/installation/compilers/)
- [Make](/installation/make/)
- [CMake](/installation/cmake/)
- [Visual Studio Code](/installation/vscode/)
- [PyCharm](/installation/pycharm/)
- [Docker](/installation/docker/)


## Why are we asking participants to install software?

We could provide a virtual machine in the cloud with everything pre-installed
and ask participants to connect to it.

However, we prefer that participants follow the workshop in the environment
where they are likely to work in future.  We would like that participants are
able to continue using tools also after the workshop, in a familiar development
environment of their choice.

We are aware that this choice comes at a price: it is very difficult for us to
provide installation instructions that work "everywhere" and it requires from
participants to do some work before they arrive at a workshop.
