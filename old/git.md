## Specific macOS installation instructions

### OS X 10.9 and higher

Install Git for Mac by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks"
installer from
[this list](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/).

After installing Git, there will not be anything in your `/Applications`
folder, as Git is a command line program.

Please also [verify your installation](#how-to-verify-the-installation)
and [configure Git](#configuring-git).


### Older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)

Use the most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard" available
[here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/).

Please also [verify your installation](#how-to-verify-the-installation)
and [configure Git](#configuring-git).


## Specific Windows installation instructions

### If you have installed Git Bash

In this case Git should be installed on your computer as part of the Bash installation.

Possible problem with this approach is that Git Bash does not see
the Python and Anaconda scripts. See also [the troubleshooting page](/installation/troubleshooting/).

Please also [verify your installation](#how-to-verify-the-installation)
and [configure Git](#configuring-git).
