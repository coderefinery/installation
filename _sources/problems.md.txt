# If you encounter any problems

- Ask a friend/colleague/local IT support. These are standard tools
  which many people can help with (and don\'t be afraid to ask - it\'s
  an unfortunate fact that software installation and configuration is
  hard).
- Before a workshop we offer 2 drop-in installation-help sessions.
  Please try by yourself first, but if you cannot solve problems, join
  in the sessions. Schedule is shown in the workshop website.
- Ask in the `#help` stream on the [CodeRefinery
  chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com). You can also send an
  email to <support@coderefinery.org> to ask questions. Please
  describe the problem concretely as well as your operating system.
