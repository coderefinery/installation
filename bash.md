# Bash

## Installation on Linux

The default shell is usually Bash, but if your machine is set up differently
you can run it by opening a terminal and typing `bash`. There is no need to
install anything.


## Installation on Mac OS X

The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is Bash, so no need to install
anything. You access Bash from the terminal (found in
`/Applications/Utilities`).

Watch the Git installation [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY)
(copyright Software Carpentry) for an example on how to open the terminal.

You may want to keep the terminal in your dock for this workshop.


## Installation on Windows

First install [MSYS2](/installation/msys2/). Once you have MSYS2 installed,
open the MSYS2 terminal (MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit or 64-bit) and you have Bash!

Try:
```
$ bash --version
```

You can close the terminal by typing:
```
$ exit
```
