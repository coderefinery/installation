# PyCharm

PyCharm is a Python integrated development environment (IDE)
for Professional/Scientific/Educational developers and
contains plenty of must-have features.

The installation of PyCharm is optional. If you are not a Python developer or are not interested
in installing a Python IDE, you can skip the installation and take the session as a demo.
If you install it, you will be able to follow the session by testing things out on your computer
during the session.


## Installation on Linux, macOS, and Windows

Please visit the [download and installation guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section) and install the
"Community" version of the software.


## How to verify the installation

After the installation is complete, please make sure you can run the application.
If you want to learn more right away, please check
[PyCharm features](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/).


## Note about the professional edition

If you are curious about the professional edition, you can download a 30-days
trial and opt-out from it later. One component of the course (profiling in the
IDE) will demonstrate a feature of the professional edition. However, it is not
necessary that you install the professional edition to follow the course.
